# Shared GIT Usage Rules  
Some guidelines for a better collaboration:  

1. **Creating a New Branch**  
   - Everyone should create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix.  
   - Branch names should follow this format: `feat/feature-name` or `fix/bug-name`.  

2. **Commits**  
   - Use clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes made.  
   - Use specific prefixes for each type of commit to make it easier to understand the nature of the change.  

   - **Examples of prefixes:**  
     - `init:` for project or branch initialization  
     - `feat:` for new features (e.g., `feat: add user authentication`)  
     - `fix:` for bug fixes (e.g., `fix: resolve page loading issue`)  
     - `docs:` for documentation changes (e.g., `docs: update README.md with ... instructions`)  
     - `style:` for style changes (e.g., `style: update .X class styling`)  
     - `test:` for adding or modifying tests (e.g., `test: add tests for login function`)  

3. **Pull Requests**  
   - Before creating a pull request, ensure the branch is up to date with the main branch (`main`).
