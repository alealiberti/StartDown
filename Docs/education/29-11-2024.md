# Navbar Creation Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the process of creating the responsive navbar for the project, with a focus on the development workflow and styling considerations. The navbar is designed to work across desktop, tablet, and mobile views, providing a user-friendly navigation experience.

## Developer: Alessio Burbulia

### Requirements

- A responsive navbar that works across different devices (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).
- Smooth transitions for menu toggling.
- Mobile-first design that ensures accessibility and usability on small screens.

### File Structure

- **HTML**: The navbar structure is built with semantic HTML, providing accessibility and scalability.
- **CSS**: The navbar's styling is done using CSS, with media queries to handle responsiveness across devices.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used to toggle the menu and handle the scroll locking for mobile view.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Mobile View (Max Width: 576px)**

   - The navbar is hidden by default and is revealed when the hamburger menu icon is clicked.
   - The hamburger icon has three spans that transform into a cross when clicked.
   - Clicking on the menu background toggles the state of the menu and prevents scrolling.

#### 2. **Tablet View (Width: 577px - 980px)**

   - The menu is displayed horizontally, with each item aligned in a row.
   - No hamburger menu is needed; the menu is always visible.

#### 3. **Desktop View (Min Width: 980px)**

   - The navbar items are arranged in a row across the top of the screen.
   - No hamburger menu is used here; items are displayed as a horizontal list.

### CSS Styling

- **Positioning**: The navbar is fixed at the top of the screen, ensuring it remains visible during scrolling.
- **Flexbox**: Used for responsive layout adjustments (flex-direction changes from column to row based on screen size).
- **Transitions**: Smooth transitions for menu visibility and hamburger icon state changes using `cubic-bezier` timing functions.

- **Media Queries**:

    - Mobile: The menu appears from the top with a sliding animation.
    - Tablet: The menu is displayed in a row format.
    - Desktop: The items are displayed horizontally with a fixed height navbar.
