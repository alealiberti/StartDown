# Home Page File Interaction Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the structure and interaction of the files used for the home page in the web project, which is built with Vite. The home pageâ€™s components, styles, and animations are organized across various directories to ensure a clean, modular, and responsive design. Below is a breakdown of the files involved and how they work together to form the home page.

## Project Structure

### Root Folder: `frontend-education`

The `index.html` file resides in the root folder, and it serves as the entry point for the web project. This file is linked to various assets and scripts that collectively render the home page.

### `src/` Folder

The `src/` folder contains several subdirectories and files responsible for the styling and functionality of the home page.

#### 1. **Components Directory: `src/components`**

Inside the `components` folder, we have reusable components specifically designed for the home page:

- **`footer`**: Contains the footer component of the home page.
    - `footer.css`: Styles for the footer component.

- **`navbar`**: Contains the navigation bar component for the home page.
    - `navbar.css`: Styles for the navigation bar component.

These components are included in the home page layout and apply specific styling to the footer and navbar sections.

#### 2. **Global Styles Directory: `src/style`**

The `style` folder contains global CSS files that apply base styles across the entire project, ensuring consistency and accessibility:

- **`global.css`**: Defines the basic CSS properties, such as typography, colors, and layout rules, that are used throughout all pages of the site.
- **`reset.css`**: Resets default browser styles to create a uniform appearance across different browsers and devices. This is essential for leveling the playing field so that styles are applied consistently.

#### 3. **Home Page Directory: `home-page`**

The `home-page` folder contains files specific to the styling and functionality of the home page.

- **`style.css`**: The main stylesheet that contains styles specific to the home page layout, including sections, text, and images.
- **`main.ts`**: The main TypeScript file for the home page, responsible for the page's core functionality and logic.
- **`key-frame.css`**: Contains keyframe animations, including effects like fade-in and scaling, which are applied to various elements on the home page.

#### 4. **Carousel Directory: `home-page/carousels`**

The `carousels` folder contains files specifically for the carousel component on the home page.

- **`carousel.css`**: Styles for the carousel, controlling its layout, transition effects, and appearance.
- **`carousel.ts`**: TypeScript file responsible for the functionality of the carousel, such as slide transitions and interactive features.

## File Interaction

### How the Files Work Together

1. **Global Styles**
   - The `global.css` and `reset.css` files are loaded first in the `index.html` to ensure all pages start with a clean slate and consistent basic styles. These files establish a uniform foundation across all pages.

2. **Home Page Styles**
   - The `style.css` file inside the `home-page` folder contains specific styles for the home page. It styles the main sections, text elements, and images, providing the overall look and feel of the home page.

3. **Components (Navbar & Footer)**
   - The `navbar.css` and `footer.css` files define the styling for the navigation bar and footer components, respectively. These components are integrated into the home page layout, with their styles applied to the respective sections.

4. **Keyframe Animations**
   - The `key-frame.css` file provides animations that enhance the home page's visual appeal. For example, elements may fade in or scale as the page loads or as the user interacts with certain items. These animations are linked in the `main.ts` file to be triggered at the appropriate moments.

5. **Carousel**
   - The carousel is a dynamic feature specific to the home page. It is styled through `carousel.css` and made functional through `carousel.ts`. The carousel displays interactive content, such as images or text slides, and is crucial for engaging users on the home page.

6. **Integration**
   - All of these files work in harmony to create a visually appealing and responsive home page. The global styles ensure consistency, while the specific styles and components (navbar, footer, carousel) apply unique styles to the home page layout. Animations bring life to the page, and the TypeScript files provide interactivity.

## Conclusion

By structuring the project this way, we ensure modularity, reusability, and clear separation of concerns. Each file and folder serves a specific purpose in the overall layout and functionality of the home page, from global styling to specific components and dynamic elements like the carousel.

This approach allows for easy maintenance and scalability while keeping the codebase organized and efficient.
