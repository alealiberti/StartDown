# SEO / TSEO Analysis of the Website

## **1. Website Structure and Content**

1. **Textual Content:**  
   - **Problem:** The content is useful, but it may be too generic. Not all texts make the most of relevant keywords.  
   - **Suggestion:** Integrate targeted `keywords` such as:
     - *Valori e Missione*  
     - *Empatia e coinvolgimento*  
     - *Educazione alla legalità*  
     - *Memoria e Impegno*  
     - *Beni confiscati alle mafie*  
     - *Sviluppo sostenibile agricolo*  
     - *Antimafia sociale*  
     - *Turismo responsabile*.

<br>

2. **Length and Depth of Texts:**  
   - Some `content are short`.  
   - More `in-depth analysis of the projects` (e.g., *E!State Liberi*) could attract organic traffic from users interested in volunteer fields.  
   - Add visual representations of concepts and data, combining text and images to help users better understand complex information.

<br>

3. **Blog and Updates:**  
   - Create a `blog con articoli regolari sulle attività`, events, and topics related to the fight against the mafia, social recovery, and organic productions.  
   - Use a clear and organized style for `CTA`: “Request Information,” “Book a Workshop.”

<br><br><br>

## **4. Technical Optimization**

### **Website Speed (Performance):**  
- **Problem:** Page load times can be improved. WordPress doesn’t handle many issues well, including:
    - **`not optimized images`, detected as the biggest issue**  
    - Image sizes that are **too large**  
    - **LGP** Largest Contentful Paint  
    - Minimize and reduce unused **CSS/JS** code.

### **Website Accessibility:**  
- **Problem:** The website's accessibility has been poorly addressed. There are many issues, including:
    - **Elements and images lack attributes, such as `[alt]`, detected as the biggest issue**  
    - Videos (frame/iframe) lack titles.  
    - The contrast ratio between background and foreground colors is insufficient.  
    - Header elements are **NOT in sequential order** (h1, h2, h3...).

### **Best Practices of the Website:**  
- **Problem:** The website's best practices are mostly influenced by third-party integrations:
    - Use of one or more `web APIs that have been deprecated` or are no longer supported.  
    - Use of many third-party cookies, a problem if these cookies do not comply with privacy regulations.  
    - Errors detected in the console, such as runtime errors in JavaScript code or loading issues (missing files/scripts with errors).

### **SEO:**  
- **Problem:** As seen earlier, SEO issues are very similar to those of accessibility:
    - **The document lacks `meta descriptions`**  
    - Elements and images lack attributes, such as `[alt]`.

## **4. Link Strategy**

### **Internal Links**  
- Create a `logical internal linking network` between the pages of the site to improve user navigation and indexing.  
- Link key sections  
     - e.g., connect "La Storia" to "Progetti Educativi" or "Attività" to "Risorse" to strengthen content coherence.  
- Use **`descriptive anchor text`** for each link so that users clearly understand the destination and subject matter.

### **External Backlinks**  
- Strengthen the website's reputation by `collaborating with non-profit organizations`, educational associations, and local institutions to obtain authoritative and relevant backlinks.  
- Propose partnerships and joint initiatives that can be mentioned on their respective sites.

<br><br><br>

## **5. Mobile-Friendly**  
The website is responsive but not well-optimized and with high-level performance:

- Ensure that buttons and links `are easily clickable`, with enough spacing to avoid touch errors.  
- Ensure that all pages are optimized with mobile-first design, as Google uses a `mobile-first indexing approach`.  
- Remove unnecessary content that may harm the mobile experience, focusing on key information.
